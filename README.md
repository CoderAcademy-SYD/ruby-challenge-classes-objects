# Challenge: Classes and Objects - The Periodic Table

You will implement a `class` called `Elements` that has a `method` which rounds atomic weight to the nearest whole number, and `attributes` that describe the element.

## Instructions

1. Perform a `git clone <url of this repo>` on this repository. Open the folder in VS Code using `code .`.
2. Open the `periodic_table.rb` and implment the requirements for the periodic table app.
3. Push your app to your own repository on Github
4. Take three deep breaths :)

## Pre-challenge Review

Check out the Canvas modules on [classes and objects](https://coderacademy.instructure.com/courses/144/modules/items/5097), [methods](https://coderacademy.instructure.com/courses/144/modules/items/5080) and [data types and variables](https://coderacademy.instructure.com/courses/144/pages/unit-data-types-and-variables?module_item_id=5077).

1. What is a class?
   A class is a blueprint for an object that has `attributes` and `methods`.

2. What is an object?
   An `object` is an instance of a `class`, the following code creates an `object` which is an instance of the `Element` class:

   ```ruby
   myObject = Element.new
   ```

3. What is an `attribute`?
   An attribute is a named value that belongs to a class such as a `name` or `date`.

4. What is a `method`?
   A method is reusable block of code that does something. When a method is part of a class, it does something related to that class.
